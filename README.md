Grimrock Castle is a short text based RPG in development for entry in the University of Pittsburgh Digital Media & Design Showcase 2024. It will consist of the main .java file serving as the 'engine' and pull from various .txt and .png files for use in different aspects of the game. It will be running on a Raspberry Pi 5 housed inside a 3D printed retro style PC case.
