You have made your way up the stone staircase leading from the outer wall to the front door of Castle Grimrock.
The looming mahogany doorway has withstood the test of time, fairing better than Gatekeep. 
You pull on the sturdy iron handle and slowly, the great doors of Castle Grimrock open...

You enter and find yourself in the Main Hall, decorated with 
fine tapestries depicting banquets, battlefields, and bones. 
The braziers slowly glow brighter, flames magically sputtering to life, as if welcoming you inside...

You look around the room, trying to eye anything of value, when suddenly, 
the door to the far right flings open!
A chattering skeleton clad in old armor with a rusted greatsword clambers forth, 
and begins patrolling the far side of the room!
