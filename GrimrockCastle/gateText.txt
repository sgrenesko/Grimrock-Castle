You approach the daunting and decrepit wooden gates that guard the crumbling wall of Grimrock Castle.
The hinges are rusting, the hardwood doors of the gate stand tall before you, locked tightly shut. 
The stone walls of Gatefront Keep stretch in either direction for miles, with no other entry way in sight. 
At the top of the wall is a rotting wooden watchtower, and at the base of the wall is the hollow remains of a tollhouse.
The air is still and the grey clouds hang low in the sky as dawn breaks into a dreary day...
